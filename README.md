# GitHub Action: Composite

This GitHub Action is developed in the `development` [branch][1] of this
repository, in particular via the command in `cmd/composite/`.

The documentation and source code for this action are maintained there. This
branch is intended to be as small as possible so it can be loaded quickly
when new jobs retrieve it when spawned as part of a GitHub Actions workflow.
